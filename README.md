Well technically rupees, but six of one half, dozen of the other!

'Legend of Zelda' themed guessing game

When the game starts you are given a random number from 19 to 120. You must select the number of rupees needed to reach that random number... but you won't know how much each rupee is worth until you click on it!

It totally doesn't work... But hey at least it looks pretty?
